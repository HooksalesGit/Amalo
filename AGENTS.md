# Agent Guidelines

- Run tests with `pytest -q` before committing.
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` when needed.
- Keep changes focused and grouped into logical commits.
- Use `render_income_tab` for new Streamlit form groups.
- Default branch is `main`; avoid creating new branches.
- When implementing new features, verify that existing functionality remains unaffected and add or update tests accordingly.
- Record each change in `CHANGELOG.md` with a brief summary and increment version next to title.
